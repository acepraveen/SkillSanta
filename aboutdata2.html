    <h2>What we do?</h2>
    <p>
        SkillSanta is a platform that aims to transform the way people attempt getting a job. <br><br>
        
        India has a serious skills shortage issue with jobs staying vacant because there simply aren’t enough skilled people and on the other hand we have millions unemployed. India 1.0 is highly trained, knows it’s way around technology and lives in and around places with lots of training and job opportunities. However, there resides another India, the one that’s talked about in news, the one for which a lot of policies are in place and sadly the one that isn’t aware enough to know how to get benefit of those policies.
        <br><br>
        India 2.0 resides in tier-2 and tier-3 cities and isn’t very resourceful. It has grown up compromising on many of its wishes, looks at the price tag first to make sure it is considering something that would be worth the hard earned money saved by the family and often ends up getting conned in the name of trainings, paid internships or fake job offers. <br><br> SkillSanta is meant to be an affordable platform that can educate people about skills in demand in their locality or a place they wish to live in, help them make an informed decision regarding what they should be learning, how they can learn those skills, provide guidance and motivation along the way and means to learn those skills through content optimized for better learning.
        <br> <br>
        There is a long way to go and the journey is always easier when you have capable people joining hands with you. If you are someone who can teach an useful skill very well, someone who wants to hire, someone who is looking for affordable ways to be good at skills that can get you a job or anyone else curious enough, you can talk to us.</p>
